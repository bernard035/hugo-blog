## Project Experience  
### PIPA (Progressive Intelligent Performance Analytics)  
**Oct 2023 – Present | SPAIL Open-Source Project**  
- Focus: Performance engineering (data collection, parsing, aggregation, call graph analysis) using Linux Perf, `sar`, and `emon`.  
- Role: Lead developer and project manager.  
- Key Achievements:  
  - Optimized PMCs multiplexing for high-precision, low-overhead on-core performance data collection.  
  - Identified lock-contention bottleneck in RocksDB `db_bench` (confirmed by project lead Mark Callaghan, [issue #12594](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/12594)).  
  - Supervisor presented findings at ACM/SPEC ICPE 2024, STW2024, and Huawei Snow Mountain Conference.  

### General Computing Common Hotspot Extraction and Hardware Acceleration Analysis  
**Jun 2024 – Present | Huawei Kunpeng Cloud Computing**  
- Objective: Mine computing hotspots and evaluate hardware acceleration value in multi-scenario environments.  
- Contributions:  
  - Led stress tests on general computing benchmarks; profiled and identified hotspot operators.  
  - Designed/developed **Common Hotspot Analyzer** (inspired by Google AutoFDO/Facebook Accelerometer) using Linux Perf, enabling call graph hotspot detection and performance analysis.  
  - Studied Kunpeng 920 CPU performance characteristics in bare-metal scenarios; developed observation strategies and presented results in closed-door meetings (highly recognized by partners).  


## Internship Experience
